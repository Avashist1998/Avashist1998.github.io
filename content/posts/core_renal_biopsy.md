## Core Renal Biopsy Project

Worked on a team which design and prototyped a novel renal biopsy device. The device reduces bleeding from the biopsy by deploying a plug to replace the biopsy tissue. 
The team used a high-speed camera to understand the mechanics of the current biopsy device and effect of the process on the tissue. 
The team designed a CAD model of the device and used FFF(fused filament fabrication) 3D printed to prototype the device. 
A risk assignment was performed on the device to quantify the severity device failure and to develop appropriate experiment/testing process to ensure the quality of the device.
