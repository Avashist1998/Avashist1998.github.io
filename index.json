[{"content":"Viola-Jones Algorithm Implement the Viola-Jones Algorithm for rapid face detection in python from scratch. First developed a feature extraction script, which extracted 2.5 thousand features from a 19 by 19 grayscale image. I applied the feature extraction script to a 2000 image of non-faces and 500 images of faces. I implemented the AdaBoost algorithm through the python multiprocessor module, leading to a decrease in execution time by 20%. I ran 10 rounds of the algorithm to achieve an empirical error of 67% on the testing data set. Feature manipulated the cost function on the algorithm to priories false-positive, which led to a 5.4% false-positive error.\n","permalink":"https://avashist1998.github.io/posts/viola_jones_algorithm/","summary":"Viola-Jones Algorithm Implement the Viola-Jones Algorithm for rapid face detection in python from scratch.

The RPG matrix was converted into grayscale single value matrix to simplify the calculation. The dimension of the grayscale matrix was changed to focus on the area of interest to increase the computation time of the program. The grayscale signal was extracted from the video and was studies in the frequency domain. An IIR filter was applied to the single to extract the PPG signal.\n","permalink":"https://avashist1998.github.io/posts/ppg_signal_extraction/","summary":"PPG singal Extraction Used Matlab to extract the RPG matrix for a single frame from a 720p video file with a duration of 10 to 15 seconds.

The device reduces bleeding from the biopsy by deploying a plug to replace the biopsy tissue. The team used a high-speed camera to understand the mechanics of the current biopsy device and effect of the process on the tissue. The team designed a CAD model of the device and used FFF(fused filament fabrication) 3D printed to prototype the device. A risk assignment was performed on the device to quantify the severity device failure and to develop appropriate experiment/testing process to ensure the quality of the device.\n","permalink":"https://avashist1998.github.io/posts/core_renal_biopsy/","summary":"Core Renal Biopsy Project Worked on a team which design and prototyped a novel renal biopsy device.
